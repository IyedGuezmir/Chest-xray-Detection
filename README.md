# 🏥 Chest X-Ray Abnormality Detection using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** to detect abnormalities in chest X-ray images. We use a dataset of **chest X-rays** to train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, classifying images into categories such as **normal, pneumonia, or other abnormalities**. The goal is to create a **robust and efficient** model that assists medical professionals in diagnosing chest conditions accurately.  

## 🎯 Objective  
The primary objective of this notebook is to **build and evaluate a deep learning model** for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images.  

By the end of this project, we aim to:  
✅ Understand the dataset and perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
✅ **Preprocess** images to make them suitable for model training.  
✅ Develop a **CNN model** to classify chest X-ray images.  
✅ **Train and evaluate** the model using appropriate metrics.  
✅ Experiment with techniques such as **data augmentation & transfer learning** to enhance model performance.  
✅ Provide **insights** into the model's predictions and discuss areas for **future improvements**.  

## 📂 Dataset  
We use a publicly available dataset of **chest X-ray images**, which includes labeled images of **normal and abnormal conditions** (e.g., pneumonia).  

- The dataset contains **two main classes**:  
  - 🟢 **Normal**  
  - 🔴 **Pneumonia**  
- Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) before training.  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
The deep learning model is built using **TensorFlow & Keras** and follows this structure:  
- **Convolutional Layers (CNN)** for feature extraction  
- **MaxPooling Layers** for downsampling  
- **Fully Connected Layers (Dense)** for classification  
- **Softmax Activation** for multi-class classification
